This repository contains my solutions to the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Project Euler is a website that offers a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems. The problems are designed to encourage problem-solving skills and explore various mathematical concepts.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler was created in October 2001 by Colin Hughes (a.k.a. euler) as a sub-section on mathschallenge.net. Since then, it has gained immense popularity and moved to its own domain in 2006. The project is primarily run by its members, who contribute new problem ideas and participate in problem development.

The website features a collection of problems, and each problem is assigned a difficulty rating. The problems range from relatively easy to highly challenging, and they cover various areas of mathematics and computational thinking.

## How to Use

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the problems, mostly implemented in C/C++. Each problem is organized in its own folder, containing the source code file(s) and a README explaining the problem statement and approach used to solve it.

Feel free to explore the solutions, study the code, and compare approaches. However, keep in mind that Project Euler emphasizes problem-solving skills and encourages individual effort. While it's acceptable to seek inspiration and research ideas on the internet, it is important not to rely on direct answers or solutions found elsewhere.

## Problem Solving Tips

- Read the problem description carefully, noting any examples provided.
- Experiment with pencil and paper to understand the problem's underlying ideas.
- Use the internet or books to gain background knowledge and explore relevant concepts.
- Write programs to generate solutions for simple cases and compare outputs with example cases.
- Estimate the time required to solve the problem and reconsider your strategy if it exceeds a minute.
- If you're stuck on a particular problem, taking a break or moving on to a different problem might help your brain make necessary connections or provide inspiration.
- Remember that the journey of problem-solving is just as important as reaching the final solution.
