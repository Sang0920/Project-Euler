# Even Fibonacci numbers

This problem is a programming version of Problem 2 from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net).

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed N, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer N.

## Constraints

* 1 <= T <= 10^5
* 1 <= N <= 4 * 10^16

## Output Format

Print the required answer for each test case.

## Sample Input

```
2
10
100
```

## Sample Output

```
10
44
```

## Explanation

For N = 10, we have the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. The sum of the even-valued terms (2, 8) is 10.

For N = 100, we have the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. The sum of the even-valued terms (2, 8, 34) is 44.
