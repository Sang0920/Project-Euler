# Largest Prime Factor

This problem is a programming version of Problem 3 from [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net).

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13, and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of a given number N?

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer N.

## Constraints

* 1 <= T <= 10
* 10 <= N <= 10^12

## Output Format

For each test case, display the largest prime factor of N.

## Sample Input

```
2
10
17
```

## Sample Output

```
5
17
```

## Explanation

For N = 10, the prime factors are {2, 5}, and the largest prime factor is 5.

For N = 17, the prime factor is 17 itself, so the largest prime factor is 17.
